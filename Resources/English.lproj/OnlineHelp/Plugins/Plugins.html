<h1>Help for PDP-8/E Simulator Plug-ins</h1>

<p>
Plug-ins for the PDP-8/E Simulator provide their own help content
that is available via additional plug-in specific menu items in the
Help menu.
</p>

<p>
When the Help Viewer does not show the plug-in help correctly with
various older macOS versions, please select the Help menu item again
while pressing the Option key. Then the help opens in Safari.
