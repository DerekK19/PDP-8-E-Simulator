    NSFileManager: Resolve an alias
    Original Source: <http://cocoa.karelia.com/Foundation_Categories/NSFileManager__Reso.m>
    (See copyright notice at <http://cocoa.karelia.com>)
    
    The old Alias Manager functions are depecated since Mac OS 10.8 and no longer work with OS X 10.10.
    The CFURL Bookmark functions are available since Mac OS 10.6. Because we build against the
    Mac OS X 10.4 SDK, we call them dynamically. For the new code, see
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21244781
